# Etch-a-Sketch

In this project, I built a fun and interactive browser-based toy that works like a mix between a **sketchpad** and an **Etch-A-Sketch**.  
It’s a small but powerful project that helped me strengthen my **DOM manipulation** and **JavaScript** skills while having fun experimenting with the browser.

## 🚀 About the Project

The idea was to create a drawing grid that reacts to mouse hover events — kind of like a digital canvas where you can “draw” by simply clicking and dragging your cursor around.  
It might sound simple, but building it required a lot of creative problem-solving, research, and experimentation with **JavaScript**, **CSS**, and **DOM methods**.

The best part? I didn’t rely on any frameworks — just pure **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.

## 🧠 What I Learned

This project challenged me to:
- Dynamically create and style elements using JavaScript  
- Use **event listeners** to handle real-time user interaction  
- Experiment with **hover effects** and **grid layouts**  
- Find and apply the right CSS and JS methods 

It was a great reminder that sometimes the best way to learn is to *figure it out as you go*.
